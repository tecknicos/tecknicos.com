Tecknicos is comprised of an open and welcoming group of technology-loving people ðŸ˜œ

Our mission is simple:
- We target small businesses, teams, and/or individuals looking to extend their business operations into the cloud space
- We help with transitioning from legacy, hard-to-manage information systems to modern, well-orchestrated and robust architectures
- We help you adopt today's industry best practices and methodologies for managing increasingly complex infrastructures that more often incorporate cloud-based compute resources  

At Tecknicos, we value the *openness* of open source, and model our sense of community around that. Our work is client-centric before all else. See our [Company Page](/community/company) if you'd like to know more of what we're about.

Our governance model is a binary process: 

- A Project Management comitte oversees open projects
- A Technical Steering committee drives technical direction

See [Governance](/community/governance) for more information.
