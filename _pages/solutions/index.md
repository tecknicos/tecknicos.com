# Solutions

Our company primarily offers two flavors of Managed Cloud Services: 

- [CCO](#tkcco)
- [CHX](#tkchx)

<span style="font-size:.5em;color:teal">Pronounced *Cocoa* and *Chex* (mmm so good)</span>

Each offering contains tailored tools and workflows that together solve the client requirement.

## CCO: Common Cloud Onboarding 

<a id="tkcco"></a>

The CCO package is meant for clients that have need for a small, yet reliable backend technology stack that is easy to manage, build up, and tear down.

Common use cases:

* Small team of developers building a mobile app that needs to communicate with a robust, scalable backend API 
* Individuals or small teams interested in offloading their continuous integration and continuous delivery processes 
* You are a business owner, and you already have the Front-end to your product down pat, but lack adequate staffing to support backoffice infrastructure
* Any combination of the above

## CHX: Complex and Hybrid Cloud Execution 

<a id="tkchx"></a>

The CHX package is meant for clients that require more complex workflows. The deliverable here is a cloud solution that is either co-managed or managed entirely by us. You'll get the same reliability as **CCO**, but with an enterprise-grade technology stack.

Common use cases:

* Small Business with in-house, fully-staffed technology stack needing help in scaling up business operations by leveraging cloud infrastructure
* Your business requirs an enterprise-grade backend deployment that meets the following requirements
	- Distributed
	- Highly Available, Fault Tolerant, Stable
